# IotWebConfAsync

This is a extenstion for the great libray . 

This library is an extension for the [IotWebConf](https://github.com/prampec/IotWebConf) library by [Balazs Kelemen](prampec+arduino@gmail.com). With this library, it is possible to use the ESPAsyncWebServer. As a result, websites become significantly faster, and WebSerial can be used.

## Librarys
You also need to install the following libraries
AsyncTCP
[ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer)

## Usage
See also the examples in the examples folder.

ï¿½nit the AsyncWebServerWrapper with the AsyncWebServer object.
```cpp
#include <IotWebConfAsync.h>

DNSServer dnsServer;
AsyncWebServer server(80);
AsyncWebServerWrapper asyncWebServerWrapper(&server);

IotWebConf iotWebConf(thingName, &dnsServer, &asyncWebServerWrapper, wifiInitialApPassword, CONFIG_VERSION);
```

Initialize the IotWebConf object and set up the required URL handlers on the web server.
```cpp
void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println();
  Serial.println("Booting");

	// -- Initializing the configuration.
	iotWebConf.init();
	// -- Set up required URL handlers on the web server.
	server.on("/", HTTP_GET, handleRoot);
	server.on("/config", HTTP_ANY, [](AsyncWebServerRequest* request) {
			AsyncWebRequestWrapper asyncWebRequestWrapper(request);
			iotWebConf.handleConfig(&asyncWebRequestWrapper);
		}
	);
	server.on("/favicon.ico", HTTP_GET, [](AsyncWebServerRequest* request) {
		AsyncWebServerResponse* response = request->beginResponse_P(200, "image/x-icon", favicon_ico_gz, favicon_ico_gz_len);
		response->addHeader("Content-Encoding", "gzip");
		request->send(response);
		}
	);
	server.onNotFound([](AsyncWebServerRequest* request) { 
			AsyncWebRequestWrapper asyncWebRequestWrapper(request);
			iotWebConf.handleNotFound(&asyncWebRequestWrapper);
		}
	);
}
```

Call the doLoop method in the loop function as frequently as possible.
```cpp
void loop()
{
  iotWebConf.doLoop();
}
```
## Debugging
If you add the following define in your code, you can enable debugging
```c++
#define IOTWEBCONFASYNC_DEBUG_TO_SERIAL
```
